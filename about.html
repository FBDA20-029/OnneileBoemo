      <h3>HISTORY</h3>
      <p class="role">Peace is life</p>
      <p>The oldest traces of human occupation in Paris, discovered in 2008 near the Rue Henri-Farman in the 15th arrondissement, are human bones and evidence of an encampment of hunter-gatherers dating from about 8000 BC, during the Mesolithic period.</p>

      <h3>GOVERNMENT</h3>
      <p class="role">Live </p>
      <p>> Paris is governed by an elected mayor and council. More than 1,200 communes, both big and small, make up the suburbs. As a result, Greater Paris is not a political unit, and cooperation between Paris and its surrounding suburbs is often lacking.</p></div>

      <h3>WEATHER</h3>
      <p class="role">Support Lead</p>
      <p>The climate in Paris is fairly mild. The average annual temperature is in the lower 50s Fahrenheit (12 degrees Celsius). Winter and spring weather, especially in the wind, can be extremely fickle. The city has taken steps to reduce air pollution and has a water purification system in place to ensure that tap water is safe to drink.</p>
